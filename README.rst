Uploadr.py
==========

Uploadr.py is a simple Python script for uploading your photos to Flickr. It also arranges them into 
sets and collections that correspond to the directory structure of your photos directory.


Instructions
==========

The script in its current version is only tested on Mac OS X so all instructions are targeted to Mac users.


Step 0. Prerequisites
--------------

1. Python

Mac OS X 10.8 comes with Python preinstalled. To verfiy that, open a terminal and type ``python -V``. If you don't have it, get it from `here <http://www.python.org/getit/>`_.

2. Git

To see if you have Git installed, open a terminal and type ``git --version``. If you donâ€™t have it, you can get the latest version from `here <https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list>`_.

Step 1. Download the script
---------------

Go to your favorite hacking directory and clone the repo::

	git clone https://github.com/tomov/uploadr.py

Then go to the script directory::

	cd uploadr.py/uploadr
	
Step 2. Run the script
---------------

Make sure to have your Flickr API key and secret (if you don't, you can get them `here <http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/>`_). Then run the script::

	python uploadr.py --dir=[photos directory] --api-key=[your api key] --api-secret=[your api secret]

Here is how this would look for an example directory and api key and secret::

	python uploadr.py --dir="/Users/tomov90/Downloads/My Photos/" --api-key=00954e229265b619362cb462da234100 --api-secret=4cf2baa933309b8e

You will be forwarded to a Flickr confirmation page in your browser. Click ``OK, I'LL AUTHORIZE I`` at the bottom, go back to the terminal and type ``Y``. You will get another prompt asking you if you are sure you want to continue. Type ``Y`` again and let python do the rest of the work!

Step 3. Re-running the script

To back up the same folder to the same Flickr account, simply run::

	python uploadr.py --dir=[photos directory]

And the upload should start immediately. You won't have to re-enter you API key and secret since the app saves them in the photo directory. The app also saves a history of all previously uploaded photos and unless you move stuff around or rename your files or directories, it will avoid uploading duplicate photos or creating duplicate sets and collections.


Advanced
===================

Script
-------------------


TODO


Files
-------------------

You will notice that the script will create a bunch of files with the prefix ```uploadr.*`  in your photos directory. Some of them will be hidden, namely::

	.uploadr.flickrToken
	.uploadr.apiKey
	.uploadr.apiSecret

Those contain your Flickr account access information so you don't have to enter it every time. However, this also means that anyone who has access to those files can access your precious photos, so make sure to avoid sending them to random people. If you ever delete them, you will have to pass the API key and secret as command-line parameters as discussed in Step 2.

In addition, the script saves a history of all uploaded photos, sets, and collections in these files::

	uploadr.uploaded_images.db
	uploadr.created_sets.db
	uploadr.created_collections.db

This helps the script avoid duplicate uploads. If you delete them, the script will still avoid duplicate uploads by first fetching a list of all images, sets, and collections from the Flickr account. In fact, if for some reason you upload photos to the same account from different directories, it might make sense to delete those files and let the script "refresh" them with the latest data in the Flickr account.

Finally, the script creates a log of failed uploads and ignored files::

	uploadr.failed_uploads.log
	uploadr.ignored_files.log

This is for debugging purposes and to make sure none of your important files were ignored or failed to upload for some reason.


What it does

Uploadr.py consists of code by Cameron Mallory, Martin Kleppmann, Aaron Swartz and
others. See ``COPYRIGHT`` for details.


Running Momchil's Version
--------------------

So I changed the code a bit to allow for collections and sets. Currently the script works like this:

1. You open uploadr.py and change IMAGE_DIR to wherever all your precious photos are

2. You run ``python uploadr.py``

3. The script will crawl the folder and all subfolders and upload all the images to your Flickr account

4. It will also order the images into sets and collections according to the directory structure, as follows:

The image with relative path ``Path/To/Some/Album/image.jpg`` will go into a photo set with the name ``Album`` (i.e. the name of the parent directory of the image) which in turn will go into a collection with the name ``Path/To/Some`` (i.e. the relative path of the parent directory of the image). Ideally, when some day Flickr releases their collections API, we will be able to create a collection ``Path`` and inside it a subcollection ``To`` and then a subsubcollection ``Some`` and then inside it a set ``Album`` and put the image there. For now though, I couldn't figure out how to do it, since the collections API is private.

5. The script avoids duplicate uploads based on the relative path of the images.

So in theory it is safe to interrupt it and run it again. Before it starts uploading anything, it scans all uploaded photos from your Flickr account and checks their relative paths (which are stored in the photo description -- please don't change that) to make sure it doesn't reupload them. Note that if you move stuff around in your photo directory or if you change the description attributes of images, sets, or collections in your Flickr account, the script may produce duplicate uploads. Also note that since all paths are relative, if you move your pictures folder somewhere else, everything should still work fine.

Also the code needs some cleaning up and I think I broke some of the originally available functionality, sorry about that. But the basic stuff seems to work. Please feel free to suggest improvements, or just fork and work on it yourself!
